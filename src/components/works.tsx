						Maker Studios is a game development studio that focuses on creating
						games for mobile devices and NFT games. I was part of the team that
						developed the companyâ€™s websites and was responsible for both
						front-end and back-end development, sometimes designing UI/UX. There
						were many opportunities to work with new technologies and learn new
						things. I am very proud to have been a part of the company.

						I was leading a small team to develop an internal tool to manage

						Japanese construction company, called Napco. This was my first
						freelance project, and it was both very challenging and very
						rewarding.
